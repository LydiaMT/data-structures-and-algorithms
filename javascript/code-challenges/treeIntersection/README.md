- [Link to tests](https://github.com/LydiaMT/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/javascript/code-challenges/treeIntersection/__test__/tree-intersection.test.js)

## Challenge

- Write a function called `tree_intersection` that takes two binary tree parameters.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
