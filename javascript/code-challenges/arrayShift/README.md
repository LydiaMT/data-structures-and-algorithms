# Challenge Summary
This README explains the processes for the arrayShift code challenge

## Challenge Description
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency

Since we were not supposed to use any methods for this function, I used only variables, conditionals, and a for loop. Since there is one loop in this, the big O for this is O(n) for space and time.

## Solution

run `npm run test array-shift.test.js` to see if test passed

### To Run Test

`npm run test array-shift.test.js`
