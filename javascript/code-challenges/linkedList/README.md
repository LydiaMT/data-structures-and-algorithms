## Test
`npm run test linked-list.test.js`

## Challenge
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
- Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
    - Define a method called `insert` which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the `head` of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
    - Define a method called `includes` which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
    - Define a method called `toString` which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
      - `"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"`
