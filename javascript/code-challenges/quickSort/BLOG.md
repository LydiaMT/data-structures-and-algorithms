# Quick Sort
## Lydia Minehan-Tubic

Quick Sort is a programming algorithm to sort an array. It is known as a divide and conquer method in that you take an array and split it. In the following pseudocode we start the algorithm with an array, the leftmost value of the array, and the rightmost value of the array. This method is recursive, and alters the array in place.

See the following pseudocode for an example of how this algorithm works.

## Pseudocode
```js
ALGORITHM QuickSort(arr, left, right)
    if left < right
        // Partition the array by setting the position of the pivot value 
        DEFINE position <-- Partition(arr, left, right)
        // Sort the left
        QuickSort(arr, left, position - 1)
        // Sort the right
        QuickSort(arr, position + 1, right)

ALGORITHM Partition(arr, left, right)
    // set a pivot value as a point of reference
    DEFINE pivot <-- arr[right]
    // create a variable to track the largest index of numbers lower than the defined pivot
    DEFINE low <-- left - 1
    for i <- left to right do
        if arr[i] <= pivot
            low++
            Swap(arr, i, low)

     // place the value of the pivot location in the middle.
     // all numbers smaller than the pivot are on the left, larger on the right. 
     Swap(arr, right, low + 1)
    // return the pivot index point
     return low + 1

ALGORITHM Swap(arr, i, low)
    DEFINE temp;
    temp <-- arr[i]
    arr[i] <-- arr[low]
    arr[low] <-- temp
```
## Under The hood

The power of quick sort comes into play with the `partition` helper function. This function starts by picking an item as the `pivot` item, and compares all items against it. This function creates a temporary left and right value, and while the left value is less than the right value check the values and see if you need to swap them one way or the other. This comes into play with the `if(arr[i] <= pivot)` conditional check. If they need to be swapped, the values are then passed into the `swap` helper function. 

At the end of the sorting process, the `pivot` value is placed in the appropriate position in relation to the left and right values that it was just sorted against.
